title: Adding View models to a Laravel project
summary: Trying to use this design pattern I've discovered in .NET a few years ago.

Since the beggining of 2017 I started to experiment with different kind of codes   and patterns I didn't used before.

One of that changes came in November when I was developing the [code of this other blog](https://github.com/lloople/blog). I saw that I was duplicating a lot of code inside my controllers on the methods for `create` and `edit` a resource, in which I use the same blade file.

Some data of that view depends on the model I'm editing or creating. For example, if it's an existing record the title should be `Edit post: {$post->title}` instead of `Create a post`. That logic applies to the form action and form method too.

I created a main `FormViewModel`, and every view model dedicated to a form extends it.

```php
abstract class FormViewModel
{

    public $model;
    public $title;
    public $action;
    public $method;

    public function __construct(Model $model)
    {
        $this->model = $model;

        $this->setTitle();

        $this->setAction();

        $this->setMethod();
    }
}
```

This view models are forced to declare the methods called on the constructor

```php
protected abstract function setTitle();

protected abstract function setAction();

protected abstract function setMethod();
```

This is an implementation of the `setTitle` method in the `CategoryDetailViewModel`:

```php
protected function setTitle()
{
    $this->title = $this->model->exists
        ? "Edit Category: {$this->model->name}"
        : "Create Category";
}
```

They can also add more logic in their own constructor, like the `PostDetailViewModel`:

```php
public function __construct(Post $post)
{
    parent::__construct($post);

    $this->published_at = $this->model->exists
        ? $this->model->published_at->format('Y-m-d\TH:i')
        : Carbon::now()->format('Y-m-d\TH:i');

    $this->categories = Category::select('id', 'name')->get();
}

```

Using the view models is very easy, the controller only needs to pass this object to the view

```php
public function edit(Theme $theme)
{
    return view('backend.themes.edit', [
        'view' => new ThemeDetailViewModel($theme)
    ]);
}
```

and the view use the object properties and methods

```blade
@section('content')
    <h1>{{ $view->title }}</h1>
    
    <form method="POST" action="{{ $view->action }}">
        {{ method_field($view->method) }}
        {{ csrf_field() }}
        ...
    </form>
@endsection
```
