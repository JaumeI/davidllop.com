title: Running old sites in Laravel Valet - Environment Variables
summary: New is good, but sometimes you need to touch that legacy code you have nightmares with.

A few days ago my Homestead machine decided to die and not booting again (I'm totally sure I broke something, [Joe P Ferguson](https://twitter.com/JoePFerguson) does an amazing job with that Vagrant machine, the 2nd most downloaded on [vagrant boxes site](https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search) ðŸ˜±)

The thing is, I already had [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/valet) installed in my Macbook, so I thought I could run the project on that one for this time.

But old sites usually were made with Apache server in mind and they use environment variables and htaccess (I'll talk about this in another post).

Since Valet does not currently support custom `.env` files, I found a few custom ways of loading the variables, but all that methods messed up with the code and I don't want to be pending of deleting those lines from `index.php` before committing to repository. It's too risky.

But checking out the content of this [pull request](https://github.com/laravel/valet/pull/474) I thought about a similar approach, without touching nginx configuration.

As the [official documentation suggest](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/valet#custom-valet-drivers), I created a file called `LocalValetDriver.php` inside the app directory with the following content


```
class LocalValetDriver extends LaravelValetDriver
{
    /**
     * Determine if the driver serves the request.
     *
     * @param  string  $sitePath
     * @param  string  $siteName
     * @param  string  $uri
     * @return bool
     */
    public function serves($sitePath, $siteName, $uri)
    {
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * Get the fully resolved path to the application's front controller.
     *
     * @param  string  $sitePath
     * @param  string  $siteName
     * @param  string  $uri
     * @return string
     */
    public function frontControllerPath($sitePath, $siteName, $uri)
    {
        return $sitePath.'/public/index.php';
    }
}
```



Then inside `frontControllerPath` I load the environment variables:


```
public function frontControllerPath($sitePath, $siteName, $uri)
{
    $this->loadEnvironmentVariables();
		
    return $sitePath.'/public/index.php';
}

private function loadEnvironmentVariables()
{
	// all env variables here
	putenv('VAR=value');
	...
		
}
```


### Ignoring the file from repositories (optional)
The only remaining action is to add `LocalValetDriver` to your global `gitignore`. This action will prevent this file with sensible information (and also not project-related) to be uploaded to the repository.

In case you don't have a file called `.gitignore_global` in your home directory, you'll need to run this command first to link it with your git configuration

```
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

Add `LocalValetDriver.php` to this file

```
echo "LocalValetDriver.php" >> ~/.gitignore_global
```
