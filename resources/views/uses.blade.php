        <h2 class="retro-title-2 pt-0">C:\Editor></h2>
        <p>For the last years I've been using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm">PhpStorm</a>, but since August 2019 I jumped into the 
        <a href="">Visual Studio Code</a> world. Mostly because of the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/Robb0wen/status/1122552691333451776">Synthwave'84</a> theme 
        <a href="https://twitter.com/Robb0wen">Robb Owen</a> baked for all of us that love 80's aesthetics. 
        I installed a bunch of plugins to work with Laravel and Vue. It's not as awesome as PHPStorm suggesting imports or moving between classes with a click, but I also want some challenging when navigating through the code. 
        It helps me thinking twice about where to write the next function.</p>
        <p>As I did with PHPStorm, I usually hide every UI section to focus on the code. I do everything with shortcuts.</p>
        <div class="text-center mx-auto my-6">
            <img class="mx-auto text-center xl:w-3/4" src="/media/uses/ide_setup.jpg"
                 alt="My desktop with IDE at the center">
        </div>

        <h4 class="retro-title-4">C:\Editor\Color Scheme></h4>
        <p>
            Currently I'm using <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode">Synthwave'84</a>. I've always used dark
            color schemes and I chosed this one
            because of it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtD0K2KQF24tC5slodfxK6z7eMo01VHS0">Retrowave</a> feeling.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="retro-title-2">C:\Window Management></h2>
        <p>
            Since I moved from Windows back in the day I missed some way to arrange the windows on the screen. I'm using
            <a href="https://www.spectacleapp.com">Spectacle</a>.
            It works with keyboard shortcuts instead of moving windows to the edge. I always modify the keystrokes for
            the four corners to match <code>cmd+opt+ctrl+[1,2,3,4]</code>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="retro-title-2">C:\Browser></h2>
        <p>
            I use Safari as my personal browser because of all the features it has regarding syncing with the iPhone. I
            also like to check the websites I made with it since I think
            that currently it's the "less standard" browser out there. For develop purposes I prefer Google Chrome for
            request inspection and console tasks.
        </p>
        <h2 class="retro-title-2">C:\Environment></h2>
        <p>
            I use <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/valet">Valet</a> for local development. Previously I've used <a
                    href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/homestead">Homestead</a> with
            great results, but now I'm focusing on newer sites without backwards compatibility, so I'm fine with just
            one version of PHP installed in my machine.
        </p>
        <h2 class="retro-title-2">C:\Database></h2>
        <p>
            <a href="http://sequelpro.com">Sequel Pro</a>. That's it. It's the best MySQL manager out there for free,
            it's <a href="https://github.com/sequelpro/sequelpro">open source and currently maintained</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="retro-title-2">C:\Console></h2>
        <p>
            Currently I'm using the MacOSX Terminal App. I always wanted to try all that stuff out there, <a
                    href="https://iterm2.com">iTerm2</a>, <a href="https://ohmyz.sh">Oh My ZSH</a>...
            But never felt the need neither found the time.
        </p>
        <h2 class="retro-title-2">C:\Writing></h2>
        <p>
            When I have to write something I chose <a href="https://macdown.uranusjr.com">MacDown</a>. It's easy to use
            and can see a live preview of the result. For writing emojis
            I use <a href="https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/">Rocket</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="retro-title-2">C:\Other Apps></h2>
        <p>For Email, Calendar, Reminders and Notes I use the Apple's default apps.</p>
        <p>For music I use Spotify and honestly I can't live without it. Recently I've also been visiting <a href="https://poolside.fm">Poolside FM</a> as it's really cool</p>

        <h2 class="retro-title-2">C:\Desktop Setup></h2>
        <p>I own a Macbook Pro 13" with TouchBar 2017 and I'm very happy with it. The keyboard feels weird at first but
            I got used to it and can't use the previous version anymore.</p>

        <div class="text-center mx-auto my-6">
            <img class="mx-auto text-center xl:w-3/4" src="/media/uses/desk.jpg" alt="My desk.">
        </div>

        <h4 class="retro-title-4">C:\Desktop Setup\Output></h4>
        <p>At home I have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-UltraSharp-27-Inch-LED-Lit-Monitor/dp/B00P0EQD1Q">Dell
                UltraSharp U2715H</a> monitor for work (MacBook)
            and Gaming (Windows, SNES Mini and NES Mini.
            <del>PlayStation Classic soon...</del>
            ).
        </p>
        <p>I use this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Laptop-Bestand-Macbook-Cooling-Patented/dp/B079N75V58">Laptop
                Stand Bestand</a> to put my Macbook side by side with the
            monitor and have two screens.</p>
        <p>My headphones are Sennheiser HD50. They're no longer in production but mine still holds the day. The audio is
            awesome and I have them for almost 15 years now. They were pretty
            cheap for the good quality. For work I'm currently using <a href="https://buy.mi.com/es/item/3182200018">Xiaomi
                Mi Headphones Comfort</a> (can't find the link in english). They
            were pretty cheap and the sound is awesome. Also they have a good ambient noise reduction which is pretty
            helpful at the office.</p>
        <h4 class="retro-title-4">C:\Desktop Setup\Input></h4>
        <p>I type using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-K70-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B01ER4B8S2">Corsair
                K70 Lux</a> Mechanical Keyboard. I've switched
            the Windows and Alt keys to match the Mac layout.</p>
        <p>I point with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-M65-Pro-RGB-Adjustable/dp/B01D63UU52">Corsair M65
                Pro</a> mouse. The back / forward buttons on the side doesn't work
            with the MacOSX and I haven't found any solution for this, but it's not really bothering me. The mouse
            feeling is awesome and I also use it when gaming on Windows.</p>
        <p>Under the keyboard and the mouse I have a <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-MM300-Anti-Fray-High-Performance-CH-9000108-WW/dp/B01798VS4C">Corsair
                MM 300 Extended</a> Mouse Pad.
            I bought it in an offer along with the mouse and the keyboard but didn't regret it. The feel is so premium
            and it has boat sails on it!</p>
        <p>Desktop table is nothing important by now. It was here when we moved in and can't get rid of it.</p>
        <p>My chair is <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/jaervfjaellet-office-chair-with-armrests-gunnared-dark-gray-black-s59275634/">JÃ¤rvfjÃ¤llet</a> from 
        IKEA (Yes, I had to copy the name from the website). It's the best chair I've ever tried and can't be happier with it. I just hope someday I would have the same at work ðŸ¤ž.</p>
        <p>I have a lava lamp on the corner. Can't remember where I bought it but it's just awesome to have it there
            while coding.</p>
